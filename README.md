Unibase attempts to be an all inclusive template with a variety of features, so that people can directly use the template for building quite complex and feature rich cross-platform applications

## Supported features

Namely, I wish to implement the following features in it

- [ ] support for both web and mobile (ios + android)
- [x] a start screen in both web and mobile
  - 50% there, created a basic page for the web and phone sizes
  - [ ] Improve page to show 4 features that the application has

- [ ] support for login and registration, and dedicated pages for so
  - [ ] Add River's Flow logo on the top
  - [ ] Add a "Hi \<User's name\>" after a sign in flow has been completed
  - [ ] Add a sign out button
  - [ ] Send email confirmation after sign up
  - [ ] Support for Google Auth
  - [ ] support for phone/sms based auth? maybe?
  - [ ] 2fa support
- [ ] auto-shrinking and expanding menu options for different screen sizes

- [ ] add a settings page
- [ ] add "organizations" with multi-user control, user's have to have a minimum of 1 organization
  - [ ] any app features (including billing) have to be implemented as a subset of the organization
  - [ ] this exists for better user control flow

### How does this setup ?

a project explaination can be found on the [how-everything-works.md](./how-everything-works.md) file, and paths where other explainations can be found

### Simplified explaination

at this point, I am creating (for display, as a placeholder), 
- A notebook alternative to google colab that uses runpod
- Uses https://marimo.io/
- It's possible to search through notebooks
- It's possible to create/delete/update notebooks
- Option for subscriptions
- There is a subscription service that can give a person credits monthly (at a discounted rate), 
  - which also gives credit discounts in the future

The app is going to add more complex features to everything, essentially being able to cancel a subscription (that will cancel after a 30 day period), or to be able to refund a purchase if the user does not like it
