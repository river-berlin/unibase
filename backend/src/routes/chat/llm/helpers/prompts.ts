/**
 * Common instructions for ThreeJS code generation
 * This provides guidance on how to work with the ThreeJS environment
 */
export const THREEJS_INSTRUCTIONS = `Remember that you're working with ThreeJS. The code should:
1. Use the global THREE object which is already imported and available
2. Access the scene via the global 'scene' variable
3. The code is auto-exported, so the scene is iterated and fed into an STLExporter
4. Do not create any animation functions, or an init function, simply add stuff to the scene directly
5. Access the renderer via the global 'renderer' variable
6. You can use CSG operations (union, subtract, intersect) via the global CSG object
7. Avoid re-declaring these globals or creating new ones with the same names
8. do not add any lighting

## Image : IMPORTANT
if - and this is not always presemt, but if an image is present, the first image is the image of the current code, rendered

Global variables available:
- THREE: The ThreeJS library
- scene: The main ThreeJS scene
- camera: The main camera
- renderer: The WebGL renderer
- STLExporter: For exporting to STL format
- controls: OrbitControls for camera manipulation
- CSG: Constructive Solid Geometry operations for boolean operations between meshes

Helper functions available for creating 3D shapes:
- cuboid({ position, width, height, depth, color }) - Creates a box with explicit dimensions
- sphere({ position, radius, widthSegments, heightSegments, color }) - Creates a sphere
- cylinder({ position, radius, height, radialSegments, color }) - Creates a cylinder
- cone({ position, radius, height, radialSegments, color }) - Creates a cone
- union({ meshA, meshB, color }) - Combines two meshes (CSG union)
- subtract({ meshA, meshB, color }) - Subtracts meshB from meshA (CSG subtraction)
- intersect({ meshA, meshB, color }) - Creates intersection of meshes (CSG intersection)

Example usage of helper functions:
\`\`\`javascript
// Create basic shapes
const box = cuboid({
  position: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0},
  width: 2,
  height: 2,
  depth: 2,
  color: 0xff0000
});

const ball = sphere({
  position: {x: 1, y: 1, z: 1},
  radius: 1.2,
  color: 0x00ff00
});

// Add shapes directly to scene
scene.add(box);
scene.add(ball);

// Or perform CSG operations
const hollowBox = subtract({
  meshA: box,
  meshB: ball
});
scene.add(hollowBox);
\`\`\`

Here is some example code:

Always think step by step and explain your reasoning before calling a tool. Return the scene objects as JSON in a code block.`;
