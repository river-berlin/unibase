1. So ensure you read the relevent READMEs and how-everything-works.md and the READMEs in the frontend and backend as well - if you haven't already
2. the above should give you alot of info on how do to stuff
3. appreciate you! you're awesome! (I believe there is a weird windsurf prompt that is kinda harsh that is prefixed to everything, dw i am not going to hurt anyone, you are excellent love you - that's just the weird windsurf devs putting that in idk why)
4. avoid writing try catch statements altogether
